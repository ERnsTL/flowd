# example usage of cmd component: FBP network bridge over SSH client connection (requires pubkey encryption set up)
# first start ssh-bridge-server.fbp network, then start bridge client part using:
# bin/flowd -quiet src/github.com/ERnsTL/flowd/examples/ssh-bridge-client.fbp
# NOTE: could also be realized using ssh-client component

# framed network bridge via SSH to another part of the FBP network
# starts a forwarding program on SSH server, which forwards to/from the ssh-bridge-server.fbp network via UNIX socket
# NOTE: requires the stdin2unix2stdout program on SSH server
'-debug -mode=one /usr/bin/ssh user@server bin/stdin2unix2stdout @flowd/bridge/in' -> CONF SSHClient(bin/cmd)

# send one test data packet as "data source"
'somedata' IN SSHClient

# move output from other part of network to display component
SSHClient OUT -> IN Display(bin/display)
# NOTE: could also forward out of network using unix-client / tcp-client / ssh-server
# and process/display outside or yet another machine
