# Example network for the cron component to generate timed events
# Start using: bin/flowd -quiet src/github.com/ERnsTL/flowd/examples/croncounter.fbp


# Create packets frequently, increasing counter every 1 second, display count

Schedule(bin/cron) OUT1 -> IN Counter(bin/counter) OUT -> IN Display(bin/display)

# every 1 seconds
'-when "*/1 * * * * * *" -to OUT1' -> CONF Schedule
# count packts, not body sizes
'-packets' -> CONF Counter


# Ask counter to send report every 10 seconds

RequestReport(bin/cron) REQREPORT -> REPORT Counter(bin/counter)

# every 10 seconds
'-when "*/10 * * * * * *" -to REQREPORT' -> CONF RequestReport


# exercise for the reader: achieve the same using only one instance of the cron component
