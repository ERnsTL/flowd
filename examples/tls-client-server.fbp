# example network of TLS client and server components

# connect out to a TLS server
# NOTE: TLS server can also be another part of the FBP network (bridge mode)

# send an HTTP request via the TLS client

# also start a chat server using TLS
# requires certificate and key
# NOTE: easily generate files for testing using https://github.com/deckarep/EasyCert
