# example network using native ssh-client component
# run using:
# bin/flowd src/github.com/ERnsTL/examples/ssh-client-reqresp.fbp

# can do server host key verification using host key line
# can use specific identity = local user private key for communication
# can give password using -p or if pubkey login fails
#'-mode one -agent -hostkey "ssh-ed25519 .... user@server" -i /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa tcp://user@server echo IT WORKS!' -> CONF ssh

# can use known_hosts for host key verfication (must have connected using ssh client once)
#'-debug -mode=one -agent -i /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519 tcp://space@bermuda echo IT WORKS' -> CONF ssh

# example with mode=each
# sends two packets to ssh client -> STDIN of cat -> STDOUT -> comes back -> display component
'-mode=each -agent -i /home/user/.ssh/id_ed25519 tcp://user@server cat -' -> CONF ssh

'3s' -> CONF delay(bin/sleep)
'message through remote cat' -> IN delay OUT -> IN ssh

'6s' -> CONF delay2(bin/sleep)
'message through remote cat the 2nd' -> IN delay2 OUT -> IN ssh

# display IPs coming out of SSH client
ssh(bin/ssh-client) OUT -> IN display(bin/display)
